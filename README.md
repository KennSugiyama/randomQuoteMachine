# RANDOM QUOTE GENERATOR
A refresher mini JS project.  Project idea came from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

## User Stories
1) User can press a button to get a random quote.
2) User can press a button to tweet out the quote.

## Error Handling
1) Some quotes do not have an author [NOT YET ADDRESSED]
2) Some tweets do not properly format. [NOT YET ADDRESSED]

## Future feature ideas
- Background image that changes according to the randomly generate quote.
- An image of the author is generated.
- A link to the author's bio is generated.
- Previously random generated quotes are displayed below each newly created quote.
